## Welcome to Bubbletill 2.0 ✨

Bubbletill is a Point of Sale solution powered by Java at the front end and Python at the backend.
<br><br>
Bubbletill is composed of 6 components:
- Point of Sale - The application that members of staff interact with to complete sales, running on a Raspberry Pi 4 B.
- Back Office - The application that members of management interact with to view analytics, manager user accounts, view transactions and more. This application can be found on the POS devices and launched through the POS application.
- Backend - Flask server that runs at the head office of each store / chain, hosting and managing all databases.
- Local Server - Flask server that runs on the local Raspberry Pis, allowing POS to interface with the buzzer and get local register / store information
- MyBT* - A web UI that allows customers to view e-receipts and their spending in-store.
- MyStore* - A web UI that allows for head office staff to view the analytics for each store and manage the configuration of all POS devices.
