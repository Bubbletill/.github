## Welcome to Bubbletill 2.0 ✨

Bubbletill is a Point of Sale solution powered by .NET Core.
<br><br>
Bubbletill is composed of 6 software components:
- Point of Sale - The application that members of staff interact with to complete sales.
- Back Office* - The application that members of management interact with to view analytics, manager user accounts, view transactions and more. This application can be found on the POS devices and launched through the POS application.
- Controller API - API for interfacing with the controller's database and services.
- Shell - Application to replace Windows Explorer on the POS devices.
- MyBT* - A web UI that allows customers to view e-receipts and their spending in-store.
- MyStore* - A web UI that allows for head office staff to view the analytics for each store and manage the configuration of all POS devices.

The heart of a Bubbletill store is the controller: it runs the Controller API and the primary database.

**Development not yet started.*

Bubbletill was initially made in Java, but due to limitations with JavaFX I am re-writing the suite for WPF using .NET Core 6.

Enjoy looking around my shoddy code! ❤️
